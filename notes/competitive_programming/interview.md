# Interview Tips

* If you cannot finish all, try to achieve something complete by not implementing all the subroutines.
* Use the first 5 minutes to confirm the details of the problem interactively with the interviewer.
* When confirming the details, try to use the testing techniques to test the details of the problem definition.
* When testing, use CLEAN: corner cases, large cases, empty cases, average cases, negative cases.
* Ask for hints if you don't have the optimal solution.,


## Google Docs Settings

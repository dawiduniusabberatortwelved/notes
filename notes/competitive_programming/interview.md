# Interview Tips

* If you cannot finish all, try to achieve something complete by not implementing all the subroutines.
* Use the first 5 minutes to clear the details of the problem interactively with the interviewer.
* When confirming the details, try to use the testing techniques to test the details of the problem definition.
* When testing, use CLNNX: corner cases, large cases, normal cases, negative cases, zero cases.
* Ask for hints if you don't have the optimal solution.,


## Google Docs Settings

* `Tools` -> `Preference`: Uncheck `Automatically capitalize words` and `Use smart quotes`.
* Change font to `Roboto Mono`.

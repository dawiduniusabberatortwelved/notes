# Cross Product

It is an operation on two 3-d vectors.
The result of the operation is a vector perpendicular to the plane that contains the two 3-d vectors.
The length of the vector is the area of the parallelogram between the two vectors.
To choose from which direction the perpendicular vector goes, we use the right-hand rule.

# Inverse Matrix

The inverse of a matrix can be seen as the opposite linear transformation.
For example, a vector is changed by a linear transformation.
The inverse of the transform matrix can transform the space,
so that the changed v would go back to its original position.
Actually, it is not only the vector but all the vectors in the space back to the original places.
Notably, if a space is squeezed into lower dimensions
(no matter real lower dimension,
or a lower dimensional space in higher dimension representations),
there is no inverse matrix for it.
